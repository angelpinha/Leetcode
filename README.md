# Leetcode
A collection of my personal solutions for leetcode problems.

## Note:
For the time being, all my submissions will be written in python. *Its just a personal preference*.

In order to test the proposed solution at runtime, You should install the `pytest` package with `pip` as follows:

```Bash
  $ pip install pytest
```

To run a solution, just execute the file as a `python` script:

```Bash
  $ python filename.py
```

To correctly syntax `filename.py`, you should replace `filename` with the actual name of the Python file containing your solution code. 
For example, if the file is named `1420.py`, you should use `python two_sum.py` to run the file.
